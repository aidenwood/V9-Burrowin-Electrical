    question: "What are access control systems and how can they benefit my building?",
    answer: "Access control systems electronically manage access to specific areas within your building. This enhances security by restricting entry to authorized personnel. Benefits include improved security, streamlined access management, and potential integration with other security systems."
  },
  {
    id: "faq-2",
    question: "What types of access control systems does Burrowin Electrical install?",
    answer: "Our electricians are experienced with various access control systems, including keycard entry, keypad entry, and RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) technology. We can recommend the most suitable system based on your security needs and budget."
  },
  {
    id: "faq-3",
    question: "How do electrical door locks function in an access control system?",
    answer: "Electrical door locks are integrated with the access control system. When a valid credential (keycard, RFID tag, etc.) is presented, the system communicates with the lock to unlock the door. This allows authorized access while restricting entry for unauthorized individuals."

  {
    id: "faq-4",
    question: "What are the advantages of using RFID tags for door access?",

  },
  {
    id: "faq-5",
    question: "Can access control systems be integrated with other security systems?",
